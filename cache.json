He didn‚Äôt take His plan or calling away from you. The devil will tell you so, but that‚Äôs a lie. God wants you to find His purpose in His timing. Your dreams are not wrong, He just needs to be the One to fulfill it through you. A sermon for when you walk around frustrated or angry. \n \nFor more services like this, check www.thisisredemption.com.  \n \nVisit our church in South Africa www.redemptionchurch.co.za. \nVisit our church in the Netherlands www.redemptionchurch.nl.",

He didn‚Äôt take His plan or calling away from you. The devil will tell you so, but that‚Äôs a lie. God wants you to find His purpose in His timing. Your dreams are not wrong, He just needs to be the One to fulfill it through you. A sermon for when you walk around frustrated or angry. \n \nFor more services like this, check www.thisisredemption.com.  \n \nVisit our church in South Africa www.redemptionchurch.co.za. \nVisit our church in the Netherlands www.redemptionchurch.nl."

That we should stop fighting for what we think is fair, but to rather bring God into every situation and let the Spirit of God lead us out of hurt, offence and disappointment and lead us into the supernatural¬†favour of God.¬†\n\nWelcome to Redemption Church Online\n\nThe programme for our Sunday services has been recorded in line with government health advisories.\n\nüëã WELCOME\nIf this is your first time tuning in or you‚Äôve just made a decision to receive Jesus as your Lord and Saviour through our online services, we have a resource that we'd like to bless you with!
